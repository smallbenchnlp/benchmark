### Small-Bench NLP: Benchmark for small single GPU trained models in Natural Language Processing

Small-Bench NLP, is a benchmark for small efficient neural language models trained on a single GPU. The benchmark comprises of eight NLP tasks on the publicly available [GLUE] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07461.pdf) datasets and a leaderboard to track the progress of the community.

***Models and Code will be published very soon. Thanks for being patient with us.***
